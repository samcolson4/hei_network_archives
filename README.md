This is a project to create a more up to date source of information for the On Cinema At The Cinema universe, a project backed at first by Adult Swim and latterly backed by the HEI Network.

There is an existing [On Cinema Timeline](https://oncinematimeline.com), which has loads of amazing information and [tools](https://oncinematimeline.com/victorville-coding-system). Sadly the last time it was updated was 2019, so it's a long way out of date.

# Development
Run this project by cloning the repo, doing an `npm install` then running:

```
